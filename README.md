# SUSEPrimeQT

(https://github.com/openSUSE/SUSEPrime/) 
(My fork https://github.com/simopil/SUSEPrime)

## REQUIREMENTS: 
>- SUSEPrime >= 0.6
>- Nvidia proprietary drivers: https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers

## USAGE:
This app has same features of SUSEPrime like switch, service management, reset, boot preference and log viewing.
You can read all information in "about" tab inside application that calls console "prime-select usage".
SUSEPrimeQt could work without root only for user-available features of SUSEPrime, execute it as root to prevent annoying password-ask dialogs.
